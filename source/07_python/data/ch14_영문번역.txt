 The award is not limited to a specific genre, but is given to writers who have achieved outstanding achievements in a variety of fields; primarily novelists, poets, playwrights, etc., and is awarded to writers who have been recognized for their literary contributions.,The Nobel Prize for Literature is not just about acknowledging literary achievement, but also evaluating the impact of the artist's work on humanity, social messages, and cultural contributions. 
 Winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature often make a major impact through works that address social issues; for example, Albert Camus won for works that address existentialism and the absurd, and Toni Morrison won for works that explore African-American history and culture.,As such, the Nobel Prize for Literature plays an important role in reflecting on the problems of the world and presenting solutions through works created by writers, rather than simply recognizing outstanding literary works.
